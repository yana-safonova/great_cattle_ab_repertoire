# The great cattle antibody repertoire
Longtitudal study of vaccination of 204 calves against the bovine respiratory disease 

The repository includes the following data:
- **aux:** antibody titers, calf ages, V gene usages, ultralong CDRH3 fractions;
- **gsv_finding:** intermediate results of IGHV gene genotyping, detected germline and somatic variations (GSVs) and their R-ratios;
- **igqtl_results:** clusters of calves computed using R-ratios of the detected GSVs.
